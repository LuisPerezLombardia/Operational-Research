# Operational-Research
This repository brings together key resources to support the development of core skills in the operational research profession. It is based on the list of techniques created by the UK Government Operational Research Service in collaboration with John Ranyard and Graham Rand from the Department of Management Science at Lancaster University Management School.

It provides guidance on when and where each technique can be applied, along with links to example projects, books, academic papers, online courses, and other supporting materials.
